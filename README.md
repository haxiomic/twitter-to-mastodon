# twitter-to-mastodon

So long and thanks for all the fish!

**Not ready yet, will write this as fast as I can, come join the fun!**

# Why are we leaving twitter?
It's now an offence to even so much as mention another social network[[0]](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy), that sort of environment is not one I feel comfortable talking in. There's plent more reasons listed over here https://twitter.com/elonmusk

# Where is the code?
Literally just started, will push as I go!

# Other tools (please suggest more!)

Find contacts that have moved

# Plan

I want to copy all my posts over to my mastodon account and I want to find all my friend who have moved too. I also want to have some way to tell people I've moved

Twitter are limiting API access for this, so this tool will scrape posts and contacts from your page instead. It should be as simple as possible and you should control all the data (I don't want to authorize anything with twitter)
